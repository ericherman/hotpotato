Sourceforge registration description

"Hotpotato" is a generic framework for distributing the units of work
for parallel processing by multiple client computers. The rise of
popularity of projects like SETI@home have shown that people are
interested in participating in distributed projects. "Hotpotato" makes
it easy to host a server to accept "orders" (chunks of work to be done),
and easy to connect client machines to the server to submit work or
process the work. Hopefully the only hard part will be in writing the
actual work since the distribution is now easy. The class loading of the
work to be done is dynamic. The classes are loaded with a security
manager and are not granted any privileges. Ideally, the server will be
able to provide some quality of service. 

The programming language is java and is deployable to any java v1.4 JVM 

Depends on:

"JUnit" http://junit.org/

"BCEL" http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/
